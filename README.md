# OR_trophic_model

<<<<<<< HEAD
The project contained in this repository derived from Andrés Pinos-Sánchez master thesis research _Trophic Modeling of Oregon’s Kelp Forest: Implications for Community Dynamics and Management Scenarios_
done at Oregon State University. The following contains a mix matrix trophic model developed in **MathLab** that simulates Oregon (OR, USA) near shore reef's dynamics of bull kelp forests, sea urchins, 
and associated species (e.g. sea otters & dungeness crab) under different management scenarios. Specifically, this study seeks to assess:
* How kelp forests responds to urchin culling and kelp restoration efforts.
* Assess the potential impacts of sea otter reintroduction on urchin, kelp, and Dungeness crab populations.

This model is a sister branch of a California trophic model developed by [Hopf et al., 2025](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.30.634607v1.abstract?%3Fcollection=).
Hopf's original model (code) was here addapted for an OR system, species and specific questions. Additionally and in order to keep connectivity between both CA and OR models, the same syntax and structured was mantained in this code; california and giant kelp parts are still contained in the code but have been turned off ***expand and better explain this part***...  **NOTE: read cheat sheets and all documentation in order to use code properly**

## Model and & model structure
**add a more detailed description**

## Sub folders
### [Code](https://github.com/BiologoPinos/OR_trophic_model/tree/Bull_Kelp_recruitment_Lag/Code), contains all scripts for the main model, runs, and parameters, as well as inputs and outputs

## Cheat sheets
The following section contains the documentation that backs-up the model coding framework both for parameter values and mathematical framwork being used. **Note** how there are two cheat sheets, one for bull kelp and one for giant kelp 

**Oregon system trophic model**;
[Nereocystis_cheat_sheet](https://github.com/BiologoPinos/OR_trophic_model/blob/Bull_Kelp_recruitment_Lag/Nereocystis_cheat_sheet.pdf)
* SPP: Nereocystis luetkeana (bull kelp), sea otters, red & purple sea urchins, dungeness crab
* Management scenarios: predator reintroduction (e.g. sea otter), urchin culling, kelp restoration (AKA seeding, reforestation)
* No heat wave
* No MPAs

**California system trophic mdoel**;
[Macrocystis_cheat_sheet](https://github.com/BiologoPinos/OR_trophic_model/blob/Bull_Kelp_recruitment_Lag/Macrocystis_cheat_sheet.pdf)
* SPP: Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp), sheephead, red & purple sea urchins
* Management scenarios: fishery clousure, urchin culling, kelp restoration (AKA seeding, reforestation)
* Heat wave
* MPAs
