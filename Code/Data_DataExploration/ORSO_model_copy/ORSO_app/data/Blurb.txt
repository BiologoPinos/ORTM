Use this simulation model to explore potential outcomes of a re-introduction of sea otters to the Oregon coast. Follow the instructions on how to use this App to the left, wait for the App to finish running the simulation, then click on the Model Output tabs (above) to see what is expected to happen. The projected dynamics are informed by data from other regions where sea otters have naturally recovered (e.g. California) or been re-intoduced (e.g. SE Alaska), including dynamics of population growth, range expansion, and how coastal habitat characteristics affect local abundance.
