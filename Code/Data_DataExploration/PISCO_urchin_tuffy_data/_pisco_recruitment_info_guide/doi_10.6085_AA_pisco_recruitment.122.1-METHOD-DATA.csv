1,tuffy_direct_count_singleside,Tuffy cut open and flattened. Counts performed directly on one side of tuffy.
2,tuffy_direct_count_doubleside,Tuffy cut open and flattened. Counts performed directly on both sides of tuffy.
3,tuffy_bleach_rinse_53,Tuffy soaked in bleach solution to dissolve mussel bissal threads then rinsed with water. The resulting solution then run through a series of sieves to collect invertebrates. The smallest sieve used was 53 microns. Sample stored in ethanol until sorted. Counts from all sieves combined for final count.
4,tuffy_bleach_rinse_250,Tuffy soaked in bleach solution to dissolve mussel bissal threads then rinsed with water. The resulting solution was then run through a series of sieves to collect invertebrates. The smallest sieve used was 250 microns. Sample stored in ethanol until sorted. Counts from all sieves combined for final count.
5,tuffy_water_rinse_250,Tuffy rinsed with water and the resulting solution run through a series of sieves to collect invertebrates. The smallest sieve used was 250 microns. Sample stored in ethanol until sorted. Counts from all sieves combined for final count.
6,safetywalk,Organisms counted directly on saftywalk plate. Lines are drown on the plate to reduce the chance of double counts. Percent cover of fouling is estimated visually.
7,rock,10x10 cm areas are cleared from all organisms using a stiff brush. Every monitoring session settled organisms are counted using a handlens and the area is scrubbed clean again.
8,tuffy_secondary_bleach_soak_250,Tuffy soaked in bleach solution after it was rinsed with water to remove any remaining organisms. The resulting solution then run through a series of sieves to collect invertebrates. The smallest sieve used was 250 microns. Sample stored in ethanol until sorted. Counts from all sieves combined for final count. This process used in conjunction with tuffy_water_rinse_250 method for most of the year 2000 data only. Counts recorded separately from water rinse method.
9,safetywalk_bleach_yes,Organisms counted directly on safetywalk plate. Lines are drown on the plate to reduce the chance of double counts. Percent cover of fouling is estimated visually. Bleach used to facilitate counting.
10,safetywalk_bleach_no,Organisms counted directly on safetywalk plate. Lines are drown on the plate to reduce the chance of double counts. Percent cover of fouling is estimated visually. Bleach not used to facilitate counting.
11,safetywalk_bleach_unknown,Organisms counted directly on safetywalk plate. Lines are drown on the plate to reduce the chance of double counts. Percent cover of fouling is estimated visually. Bleach not recorded as being used but may have been. Bleach use an uncommon practice.
12,turfy_water_rinse_417,Turfy rinsed with water and the resulting solution run through a series of sieves to collect invertebrates. The smallest sieve used was 417 microns. Counts from all sieves combined for final count.
