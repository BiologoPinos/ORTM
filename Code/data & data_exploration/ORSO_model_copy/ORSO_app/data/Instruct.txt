HOW TO USE THIS APP: To explore potential outcomes of a sea otter re-introduction in Oregon: (1) Select a coastal section (refer to locations on the map) where otters could be re-introduced; (2) Use sliders to adjust the number of otters to introduce to this coastal section, as well as any additional animals to be added in subsequent years; 3) Click 'Update table' button to add these reintroduction parameters to simulation, and repeat if desired for addition coastal sections; 4) Modify any of the other model parameters below to explore their effects (hover the mouse over each slider to see what each term means); and (3) Run the simulation by clicking on the 'Run' button.
